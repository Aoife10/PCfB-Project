# PCfB-Project
Colour maps showing genetic diversity of seagrass

Aim: Create a colour-scaled map showing the level of genetic diversity of different populations of Posidonia oceanica using data from Jahnke et al., (2015) and create maps showing the scale of human impact on the Meditteranean with data from Micheli et al.,(2013)

Work flow: Reformat data in gedit. From the Shell run the python script and ask for the relevant data. The output of the python script is saved in the current working directory. Next, run the R script from the Shell and maps are created in R and saved. The R script consists of functions to make a map.
